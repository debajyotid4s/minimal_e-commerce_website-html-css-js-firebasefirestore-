"Anusswar" - this is an e-commerce website of a physical shop on the same name. It was established in 2020.

This was a very simple, clean and minimal website for buying their goods, purchasing their teacheing service and browse. As the project's activites are simple the inside structure is also simple. I didn't use any framework for frontend, used HTML, CSS and JavaScript(vanilla). For the backend language used is JavaScript. And for authentication and database I used FirebaseFirestore. This is one of my most favourite database for it's serverless workflow and No-SQL - Document oriented structure. In future I am willing to make the same website with more aesthetic frontend with React and Tailwind CSS. Happy Coding!
